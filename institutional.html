      <h1>Retail Behavior During Real Volatility Episodes</h1>\
      <p>\
        While the survey captures how our respondents <em>say</em> they would\
        trade under different data environments, the second half of the\
        project uses an anonymized <strong>Robinhood order-flow dataset</strong>\
        to observe how retail investors actually behaved during volatility spikes.\
      </p>\
      <p>\
        My partner\'92s analysis focuses on:\
      </p>\
      <ul class="list">\
        <li>Changes in net buying vs. selling around major volatility events.</li>\
        <li>Concentration in a few \'93lottery\'94 stocks vs. diversified positions.</li>\
        <li>Timing of trades relative to intraday price moves and news releases.</li>\
      </ul>\

      <h2>Connecting Back to the Survey</h2>\
      <p>\
        We interpret the Robinhood data through the lens of our survey results:\
      </p>\
      <ul class="list">\
        <li>\
          Survey respondents with limited data access (Trade X) are more likely\
          to rely on social sources (Discord, friends) and platform defaults.\
          In the Robinhood data, this shows up as herding into a small set of\
          highly visible tickers.\
        </li>\
        <li>\
          Confidence rises in the institutional-style environment (Trade Y)\
          without a corresponding increase in expected returns. In the\
          order-flow data, we look for signs that overconfidence plus\
          easy access to trading leads to <em>excess turnover</em> during\
          volatility spikes.\
        </li>\
        <li>\
          Respondents who dislike delayed quotes also report larger perceived\
          fairness gaps between Trade X and Trade Y. In Robinhood, we examine\
          whether poorer execution timing for small orders could be one\
          channel through which \'93data inequality\'94 becomes a fairness problem.\
        </li>\
      </ul>\
      <p>\
        Together, the survey and order-flow evidence suggest that institutional\
        investors not only enjoy better data, but may also systematically end\
        up trading <em>against</em> retail investors who are both less informed\
        and more overconfident \'96 especially during stress periods.\
