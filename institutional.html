          This section summarizes the empirical analysis based on the <strong>historical Robinhood order-flow dataset (2018–2020)</strong> and <strong>institutional holdings 
          data (using quaterly 13F filings from SEC)</strong>. It provides real-world evidence of how retail investors behaved around major volatility spikes and compares this 
          with institutional-level information access.

              <h2 class="section-heading">Why These Stocks?</h2>
          
              <div class="method-section">
                <p class="method-paragraph">
                  Our selection of stocks was divided into four categories in the interest of capturing
                  inherent differences in investor demographic across different stocks. The “retail heavy”
                  group (<strong>Tesla, AMC, Beyond Meat, Plug Power</strong>) consists of firms that have historically attracted
                  large proportions of private individual investors due to high volatility, strong narrative-driven sentiment,
                  and widespread social media engagement, especially during our target time period. Their price dynamics have
                  been shown in prior research to be particularly sensitive to sentiment, attention shocks, and
                  limited-information trading.
                </p>
          
                <p class="method-paragraph">
                  The “institutional heavy” group (<strong>JP Morgan, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, ExxonMobil,
                  Berkshire Hathaway</strong>) are mature, stable firms with deep analyst coverage, predictable fundamentals,
                  and consistent institutional ownership. These stocks act as a contrast where professional investors dominate
                  trading, market microstructure is more efficient, and information is processed quickly by sophisticated
                  algorithms and research teams.
                </p>
          
                <p class="method-paragraph">
                  The “large cap” category (<strong>Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Alphabet</strong>) contains the market’s most widely held
                  and liquid companies, with significant participation from both retail and institutional investors. The stocks in this
                  category were chosen to serve as a more neutral or benchmark group.
                </p>
          
                <p class="method-paragraph">
                  Finally, the miscellaneous group (<strong>Moderna, Boeing, Ford</strong>) includes firms that experienced idiosyncratic shocks
                  during the sample period, allowing the study to examine whether information asymmetry manifests differently under
                  event-driven conditions. Overall, the building of these categories allows us to possess a balanced sample of stocks
                  for isolating how unequal access to high-quality, real-time data affects investor behavior across distinct market
                  environments.

                Retail order-flow showed strong sensitivity to price momentum, often reacting <strong>after</strong) major institutional moves.
