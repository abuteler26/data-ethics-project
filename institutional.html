          This section summarizes the empirical analysis based on the <strong>historical Robinhood order-flow dataset (2018–2020)</strong> and <strong>institutional holdings 
          data (using quaterly 13F filings from SEC)</strong>. It provides real-world evidence of how retail investors behaved around major volatility spikes and compares this 
          with institutional-level information access.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Why These Stocks?</h2>

                      <p class="method-paragraph">
                        Our selection of stocks was divided into four categories in the interest of capturing
                        inherent differences in investor demographic across different stocks. The “retail heavy”
                        group (<strong>Tesla, AMC, Beyond Meat, Plug Power</strong>) consists of firms that have historically attracted
                        large proportions of private individual investors due to high volatility, strong narrative-driven sentiment,
                        and widespread social media engagement, especially during our target time period. Their price dynamics have
                        been shown in prior research to be particularly sensitive to sentiment, attention shocks, and
                        limited-information trading.
                      </p>
                
                      <p class="method-paragraph">
                        The “institutional heavy” group (<strong>JP Morgan, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, ExxonMobil,
                        Berkshire Hathaway</strong>) are mature, stable firms with deep analyst coverage, predictable fundamentals,
                        and consistent institutional ownership. These stocks act as a contrast where professional investors dominate
                        trading, market microstructure is more efficient, and information is processed quickly by sophisticated
                        algorithms and research teams.
                      </p>
                
                      <p class="method-paragraph">
                        The “large cap” category (<strong>Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Alphabet</strong>) contains the market’s most widely held
                        and liquid companies, with significant participation from both retail and institutional investors. The stocks in this
                        category were chosen to serve as a more neutral or benchmark group.
                      </p>
                
                      <p class="method-paragraph">
                        Finally, the miscellaneous group (<strong>Moderna, Boeing, Ford</strong>) includes firms that experienced idiosyncratic shocks
                        during the sample period, allowing the study to examine whether information asymmetry manifests differently under
                        event-driven conditions. Overall, the building of these categories allows us to possess a balanced sample of stocks
                        for isolating how unequal access to high-quality, real-time data affects investor behavior across distinct market
                        environments.

            Robinhood user positions from 2018–2020. While institutional adjustments move gradually and cyclically, retail participation accelerates 
            sharply during major volatility spikes, particularly in early 2020.

            across multiple stocks. These dramatic inflows, especially into highly narrative-driven names like Tesla, Amazon, and Plug Power, align with 
            the onset of COVID-19 volatility and illustrate how retail investors respond sharply to market shocks.

            infrequent. Apart from isolated spikes driven by reporting quirks or major rebalancing events, institutional portfolios exhibit low volatility 
            in position changes; highlighting the slower, more deliberate trading behavior of professional investors relative to the sharp swings seen in retail activity.

            These shifts reflect broad market movements and institutional rebalancing rather than rapid sentiment-driven trading. The notably sharp spikes in 
            early 2020 correspond to pandemic-driven volatility, when institutions adjusted exposures across the largest benchmark stocks.
