                A modern <strong>survey experiment</strong> where UChicago students make
                hypothetical trading decisions under limited / delayed information, mimicking a
                retail setting with 15-minute quote delays and less data.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Why This Project Matters</h2>
          <div class="rq-stack">
            <p class="question">
              <strong>Why We Care.</strong>
              During volatility spikes, retail investors often trade on delayed quotes, fragmented
              news, or social media, while institutional investors rely on real-time order books,
              analytics, and execution algorithms. That information gap can create an uneven
              playing field where some traders systematically face worse prices, more risk, or
              stronger behavioral biases. Understanding this gap matters for
              <strong> fairness</strong> (who bears the risk),
              <strong> responsibility</strong> (how platforms design access to data),
              and <strong>transparency</strong> (whether investors understand the limits of what
              they see).
            </p>

            <p class="question">
              <strong>What We Build On.</strong>
              Prior research in behavioral finance shows that retail investors trade more
              pro-cyclically, chase momentum, and underperform after costs relative to
              institutions. Work on payment-for-order-flow and zero-commission trading raises
              questions about execution quality and hidden costs. However, fewer studies directly
              compare <em>perceived fairness, confidence, and expectations</em> across different
              information environments during high-volatility events.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
              <strong>What We Do.</strong>
              We ask UChicago students to make two hypothetical trades: a “retail-like” delayed-data
              setting (Trade X) and an “institutional-like” richer-data setting (Trade Y). We
              measure expected returns, confidence, allocation size, risk attitudes, and fairness
              perceptions. We then connect these patterns to a real Robinhood order-flow dataset to
              see whether the behaviors we observe in the lab line up with how retail traders
              actually behaved in 2018–2020 during volatility spikes.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
              <strong>Limitations & Next Steps.</strong>
              Our survey investors are students making hypothetical choices, not real-money trades,
              and our institutional benchmark is a richer-data treatment rather than true
              institutional access. Future work could extend this design to professional traders,
              incorporate actual financial incentives, and test alternative information regimes
              (e.g., fee-based “premium” data vs. equal-access public feeds).
