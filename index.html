            <h2 class="section-heading">Research Question</h2>
            <p class="question question-main">
              How does unequal access to real-time, high-quality data affect retail vs. institutional
              investors’ decision-making and performance during volatility spikes, and what ethical
              concerns arise for fairness, responsibility, and transparency in financial markets?
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Why Is This Question Important?</h2>
            <p class="question">
              Retail investors play a crucial role in the stock market, influencing price trends with 
              sheer force of numbers. We saw this with the Gamestop (GME) short squeeze in January 2021. Therefore, 
              exploring the ethics of information access considering the collecvtive power of the retail investor 
              appeared important to us. We care because during volatility spikes, retail investors often trade on delayed quotes, fragmented
              news, or social media, while institutional investors rely on real-time order books,
              analytics, and execution algorithms. That information gap can create an uneven
              playing field where some traders systematically face worse prices, more risk, or
              stronger behavioral biases. Understanding this gap matters for
              <strong> fairness</strong> (who bears the risk),
              <strong> responsibility</strong> (how platforms design access to data),
              and <strong>transparency</strong> (whether investors understand the limits of what
              they see).

                <span class="badge badge-retail">Trade X – Retail-like</span><br />
                A modern <strong>survey experiment</strong> where primarily UChicago students make
                hypothetical trading decisions under limited / delayed information, mimicking a
                retail setting with 15-minute quote delays and less data. Under this situaion we
                gauge an idea of allocations, expected returns, confidence, and personal ethical sentiment.

              <li>
                <span class="badge badge-inst">Trade Y – Institutional-like</span><br />
                The same survey was conducted in this case to the retail investors, but now with
                <strong>richer, real-time information</strong>, approximating institutional data access.
                The additonal information given included exact details for earnings per share (EPS) and revenue, 
                market data, and theoretical analyst recomendations.

                <strong>institutional holdings data</strong> (2018–2024) that shows
                how retail investors actually behaved around episodes of extreme volatility.
