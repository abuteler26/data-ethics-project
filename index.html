            <p class="question question-main">
              How does unequal access to real-time, high-quality data affect retail vs. institutional
              investors’ decision-making and performance during volatility spikes, and what ethical
              concerns arise for fairness, responsibility, and transparency in financial markets?
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Why Is This Question Important?</h2>
            <p class="question">
              Retail investors play a crucial role in the stock market, influencing price trends with 
              sheer force of numbers. We saw this with the Gamestop (GME) short squeeze in January 2021. Therefore, 
              exploring the ethics of information access considering the collecvtive power of the retail investor 
              appeared important to us. We care because during volatility spikes, retail investors often trade on delayed quotes, fragmented
              news, or social media, while institutional investors rely on real-time order books,
              analytics, and execution algorithms. That information gap can create an uneven
              playing field where some traders systematically face worse prices, more risk, or
              stronger behavioral biases. Understanding this gap matters for
              <strong> fairness</strong> (who bears the risk),
              <strong> responsibility</strong> (how platforms design access to data),
              and <strong>transparency</strong> (whether investors understand the limits of what
              they see).

            <h2 class="section-heading">What We Build On</h2>
            <p class="question question-main" style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6;">
              Growing divergence in data access between retail and institutional investors has led to an increase in interest in the way information quality shapes market behavior, 
              volatility, and fairness. Recent literature points out that access to real-time data is a market force interacting with investor psychology, social dynamics, and the 
              structure of the market. Literature on retail-institutional competition, retail attention dynamics, and behavioral volatility provides a solid framework for understanding 
              why unequal access to high-frequency information may produce systematically different outcomes across investor groups, especially during volatility spikes.
            <br><br>

              First, Li (2023) describes how retail investors' trading decisions are strongly influenced by social dynamics, online narratives, and sentiment shocks, particularly 
              when information is scarce, delayed, or noisy. Using a model of retail investors, long-only institutions, and short sellers, Li shows that retail-driven sentiment surges 
              can produce significant price pressure when institutional investors withdraw, giving rise to mispricing episodes like that seen in the 2021 GameStop short squeeze. Most crucially, 
              Li's results suggest that when retail investors lack real-time signals that institutions possess, sentiment serves as a substitute for information. It is this substitution that makes 
              retail participants more susceptible to volatility spikes and more likely to herd into positions without understanding the underlying risk. For our research, Li (2023) provides a 
              theoretical reasoning for why retail participants in our limited-information condition may rely more on intuition, social heuristics, or perceived momentum than participants in 
              rich-information positions and why such reliance raises ethical questions regarding fairness and transparency.
            <br><br>

              Second, the literature on attention-driven retail behavior reinforces the importance of information frictions. The 2024 study on “Active Attention, Retail Investor Base, and 
              Stock Returns” examines thousands of U.S. equities and finds that increases in retail investor attention predict short-term increases in both trading activity and returns. These 
              dynamics intensify during periods of market stress, when attention spikes disproportionately among retail investors relative to institutions. When retail users lack real-time 
              information, they often respond to coarse signals such as trending tickers, news headlines, or social-media chatter, patterns we observe in our historical dataset during Vix spikes. 
              This literature suggests the expansion or contraction of the retail “investor base” in our Robinhood dataset is not simply a trading metric but a response to limited or delayed information. 
              This framework motivates our comparison of normalized Robinhood and 13F changes during volatility events and supports our hypothesis that information scarcity amplifies attention-driven 
              behavior among retail participants.
            <br><br>

              Third, recent evidence links retail activity to increases in idiosyncratic volatility. A 2025 study on retail investors and the behavioral component of idiosyncratic volatility 
              finds that retail trading intensity is positively related to firm-specific volatility, even after accounting for fundamentals. The authors interpret this result as evidence of noise 
              trading, driven by behavioral biases that become exacerbated by limited or delayed information. The effect is most pronounced for stocks with low institutional ownership-in other words, 
              exactly those types of names that dominate retail portfolios on platforms like Robinhood. For the purposes of our project, if retail behavior does in fact contribute to volatility during 
              periods when information is most noisy, then unequal data access is not only a fairness issue but a market-stability issue. By comparing retail and institutional positioning around 
              volatility spikes in our data-including the activity of Robinhood from 2018 to 2020 and 13F filings from 2018 to 2020-we seek to explore whether this trend does, in fact, appear in real-world 
              order-flow data.
            <br><br>

              Taken together, these studies raise three ethical considerations important to our research question. First, there is the issue of fairness: without institutional-grade, real-time data, 
              retail investors seem more prone to sentiment-driven trading and amplification of volatility. Then, there is responsibility: platforms that mediate retail market information access can 
              inadvertently affect investor behavior through the speed and framing of the information they present. Lastly, transparency comes into question: retail investors generally do not comprehend 
              the limitations of delayed quotes, partial order-book information, or reduced analytics, which raises concerns about informed consent and clarity in disclosures.
            <br><br>

                Our study builds on those insights by providing a unique combination of evidence that includes experimental data from controlled retail-like and institutional-like trading environments, 
              and historical market data comparing retail user growth with institutional holdings during real volatility shocks. We extend the literature by directly investigating how disproportionate 
              access to high-frequency information affects the quality of decision-making, perceived risk, and market dynamics across investor types.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Methodology</h2>
            <p class="question question-main" style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6;">
            Our methodology combined two complementary data sources to understand how information access shapes investor behavior. 
            First, we analyzed historical Robinhood order-flow data and institutional 13F filings to compare how retail and institutional 
            investors react to market volatility and stock-specific movements. We grouped stocks into economic categories, normalized the data, 
            ran time-series comparisons, and examined deviations that might signal information asymmetry.
            <br></br>
            Second, we designed and ran a behavioral survey where participants were exposed to two information environments: a retail-style 
            environment (limited, delayed information) and an institutional-style environment (rich, real-time data). Respondents provided expected 
            returns, confidence ratings, and position sizes for each trade. We analyzed the results using summary statistics, paired t-tests, and 
            regressions. This mixed-methods approach allowed us to measure both real-world and experimental differences in behavior.
            <br></br>
            Finally, to address this problem, we have created this website to allow the retail-investor to be more informed through
            our findings. In addition to this, we created a model for the U.S. equities that we addressed aiming to help 
            retail investors make more informed decisions for these stocks. 
            </p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">Potential Pitfalls</h2>
            <p class="question question-main" style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6;">
            Several limitations could affect the interpretation of our findings. The survey sample size was relatively small, which reduces 
            statistical power and makes it difficult to detect subtle behavioral differences. Additionally, participants may not perfectly mimic real 
            trading behavior when answering survey questions, especially if they lack market experience or do not feel real financial risk. 
            <br></br>
            On the data side, Robinhood order-flow represents only one segment of retail investor activity, and 13F filings provide quarterly—not real-
            time—snapshots of institutional positions. This difference in reporting granularity may hide short-term dynamics. Finally, stock-specific factors 
            or macroeconomic events may influence trading behavior in ways unrelated to information access, introducing noise into the comparison between retail 
            and institutional flows.
            </p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">Human Subjects</h2>
            <p class="question question-main" style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6;">
            Our study involved human subjects through a voluntary survey measuring investor expectations, confidence, and decision-making under different information conditions. Participants were informed that the survey was anonymous, collected no personal identifiers, and posed minimal risk. All responses were used solely for academic analysis.
            <br></br>
            We ensured responsible use of human data by avoiding any collection of sensitive information and by limiting the analysis to aggregated behavioral patterns rather than individual profiling. The experiment's design adhered to ethical guidelines for low-risk behavioral studies.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Our Progress Explained</h2>
            <p class="question question-main" style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6;">
            Over the course of the project, we made substantial progress both in data analysis and experimental design. We cleaned and processed large-scale historical datasets, constructed normalized time-series comparisons, and identified key divergences between institutional and retail trading activity. We then designed and implemented a randomized-information survey experiment that allowed us to test causal hypotheses about the role of information access.
            <br></br>
            One of the biggest challenges we overcame was ensuring that retail versus institutional differences were not driven by structural artifacts in the data. Similarly, interpreting behavioral survey responses required careful statistical testing to separate noise from meaningful effects. Through iterative modeling, clustering, and hypothesis refinement, we built a cohesive narrative showing how data richness affects investor confidence and decision-making.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="question question-main" style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6;">
            <p style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6;">
            Across both real-market data and controlled survey experiments, our findings converge on a central insight: richer, institutional-style information makes investors more confident—but not more optimistic. Retail investors, who often rely on delayed or limited information, exhibit stronger momentum chasing and react more forcefully to volatility spikes. Institutional investors, by contrast, adjust more gradually and position ahead of market swings due to better data access.
            <br></br>
            In the survey, participants given institutional-style information showed significantly higher confidence and slightly larger position sizes, but their expected returns were nearly identical to those in the retail-style environment. This suggests that better information improves calibration rather than inflating beliefs. Ultimately, information quality shapes how aggressively people act—not what they believe will happen.
            </p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">Limitations & Future Considerations</h2>
            <p class="question question-main" style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6;">
            While our findings are informative, several limitations constrain what we can conclude. The survey sample was small and heterogeneous, making it difficult to detect subtle behavioral differences across demographic groups. The historical data, although rich, cannot perfectly isolate causality because institutional and retail investors operate in fundamentally different environments.
            <br></br>
            Future work could expand the survey to a larger population, incorporate financial incentives to mimic real risk-taking, and use more granular institutional trading data. Additional experiments could test how investors react to algorithmic summaries, real-time alerts, or alternative data sources. With more time and resources, the project could more rigorously map the behavioral gap between retail and institutional investors and evaluate interventions that help retail investors make more informed decisions.
