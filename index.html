          How Data Accessibility Shapes Retail vs. Institutional Investors
        </h1>

          We study how differences in <span class="highlight">information access</span> affect
          decision-making, perceived fairness, and outcomes during high-volatility events.

  <!-- Bubble 1: Research Question (green) -->
  <div class="rq-bubble rq-main-bubble">
    <h3>Research Question</h3>
    <p>
      “How does unequal access to real-time, high-quality data affect retail vs. institutional investors’ decision-making
      and performance during volatility spikes, and what ethical concerns arise for fairness, responsibility, and
      transparency in financial markets?”
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Bubble 2: Why We Care -->
  <div class="rq-bubble">
    <h3>Why We Care</h3>
    <p>
      During volatility spikes, retail investors often trade on delayed quotes, fragmented news, or social media,
      while institutional investors rely on real-time order books, analytics, and execution algorithms. That gap in
      information access may turn “the market” into an uneven playing field, where some traders systematically face
      worse prices, more risk, or higher behavioral biases. Understanding this gap matters for <strong>fairness</strong>
      (who bears the risk), <strong>responsibility</strong> (how platforms design data access), and
      <strong>transparency</strong> (whether investors understand the limits of the information they see).
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Bubble 3: Prior Work & Gap (optional, you can keep or edit) -->
  <div class="rq-bubble">
    <h3>What We Build On</h3>
    <p>
      Prior research in behavioral finance shows that retail investors trade more pro-cyclically, chase momentum, and
      underperform after costs relative to institutions. Work on payment-for-order-flow and zero-commission platforms
      raises additional concerns about execution quality and hidden costs. However, fewer studies directly compare
      <em>perceived fairness, confidence, and expectations</em> across different information environments. Our project
      fills that gap by pairing a modern survey experiment with historical order-flow data.
    </p>

  <!-- Bubble 4: What We Do in This Project (optional) -->
  <div class="rq-bubble">
    <h3>What We Do</h3>
    <p>
      We ask UChicago students to make two hypothetical trades under a “retail-like” delayed-data setting (Trade X)
      and an “institutional-like” richer-data setting (Trade Y). We measure expected returns, confidence, allocation
      size, risk attitudes, and fairness perceptions. We then connect these patterns to a real Robinhood order-flow
      dataset to see whether the behaviors we observe in the lab align with how retail traders actually behaved in
      2018–2020 during volatility events.

                A modern <strong>survey experiment</strong> where UChicago students make
