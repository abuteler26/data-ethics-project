    <h1>How Data Accessibility Shapes Retail vs. Institutional Investors</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        We study how differences in information access affect decision-making,
        perceived fairness, and outcomes during high-volatility events.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our project combines two sources of evidence:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>A modern survey experiment</strong> where UChicago students make
          hypothetical trading decisions under two information environments:
          a <em>retail-like setting</em> (Trade X) with delayed / limited data, and
          an <em>institutional-like setting</em> (Trade Y) with richer, real-time information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A historical Robinhood order-flow dataset</strong> that captures
          how actual retail investors behaved around extreme volatility between 2018–2020.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ultimately, we ask:
        <em>
          “How does unequal access to real-time, high-quality data affect
          retail vs. institutional investors’ decision-making and performance
          during volatility spikes, and what ethical concerns arise for fairness,
          responsibility, and transparency in financial markets?”
        </em>
