          This section summarizes insights from our survey of primarily University of Chicago students,
          designed to understand how individual investors think, learn, and behave in financial
          markets. The survey adds essential context to the retail patterns observed in the
          Robinhood order-flow data by highlighting the human motivations behind investment decisions.

          The visualizations below show demographic distributions (such as academic year and investing
          experience), self-reported trading behavior, risk attitudes, and information sources used by
          students. Together, these results help bridge the gap between quantitative order-flow patterns
          and the behavioral factors that drive real-world retail investor actions.

          <h2 style="color: #ffffff; margin-bottom: 12px;">
            Why Did We Run Regressions?
          </h2>
          <br></br>
          
            <p style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6;">
              The survey experiment placed participants into two trading environments:
              <strong>Trade X</strong> (retail-style, limited information) and
              <strong>Trade Y</strong> (institutional-style, richer information).
              For each trade, we asked three key questions:
              their <strong>expected return</strong>, their <strong>confidence</strong>,
              and how much of their portfolio they would <strong>allocate</strong> to the trade.
            </p>
        
            <p style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 16px;">
              We then used summary statistics and regressions to test whether “better access”
              in Trade Y changed behavior after controlling for background factors  
              (e.g., risk attitudes, experience, information sources).  
              In other words, we wanted to know:
              does richer, institutional-style information make people
              <em>more optimistic</em>, <em>more confident</em>, or simply
              <em>change how aggressively they size the trade?</em>
            </p>

          <br></br>
          <h2 style="color: #ffffff; margin-bottom: 12px;">
            Summary Statistics Findings:
          </h2>
          <br></br>
          
            <p style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6;">
              The table below shows the distribution of responses for expected returns,
              confidence, and allocations in each environment.
              Average <strong>expected returns</strong> are similar for Trade X and Trade Y
              (around 9–10%), suggesting that better information
              <strong>does not make people more optimistic</strong> about payoffs.
            </p>
        
            <p style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 16px;">
              In contrast, average <strong>confidence</strong> is clearly higher in Trade Y,
              and average <strong>allocation</strong> is slightly larger as well.
              Regression results, as you will see below, reinforce this pattern.
              After controlling for individual characteristics,
              being in the institutional-style environment is associated with
              <strong>higher confidence</strong> and a modest increase in position size,
              but <strong>no inflation in expected returns</strong>.
            </p>
        
            <p style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 16px;">
              These findings suggest that better access makes investors
              <strong>more certain</strong> about their beliefs and
              <strong>a bit more willing to commit capital</strong>,
              without encouraging unrealistic expectations.
              <strong>Institutional-style information seems to improve
              calibration rather than fueling over-optimism.</strong>

                Correlations & Tests
            </h2>
            <br></br>
        
            <p style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6;">
                To deepen the survey analysis, we examined correlations between expected returns,
                confidence, risk attitudes, and behavioral traits in both trading environments.
                The goal was to understand whether <strong>confidence was grounded in information quality</strong>
                or simply a by-product of optimism or personality traits.
                In the retail-style environment (Trade X), confidence correlated positively with expected
                returns (r ≈ 0.30), suggesting that less-informed investors may equate higher optimism with
                higher confidence. In contrast, in the institutional-style environment (Trade Y), confidence and
                expected returns were slightly negatively correlated (r ≈ −0.10), indicating that richer
                information helps separate confidence from wishful thinking. This suggests that institutional-style
                access makes investors more calibrated and less reliant on optimistic return projections.
            </p>
        
            <p style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 16px;">
                We then used paired t-tests to formally test whether information access caused measurable
                behavioral differences. The results showed <strong>no significant difference in expected
                returns</strong> between the two environments (p ≈ 0.85), meaning better information did not inflate
                optimism. However, <strong>confidence increased significantly</strong> in Trade Y (p ≈ 0.037), and there
                was also a <strong>modest but statistically significant increase in position size</strong> (p ≈ 0.012).
                Together, these results show that richer, institutional-level information makes investors
                more confident and slightly more willing to commit capital, but without encouraging
                unrealistic optimism. In short, better information improves <strong>calibration</strong>, not
                overconfidence.

            Who Benefits Most from Better Information?
          </h2>
            <br></br>
        
          <p style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6;">
            After showing that institutional-style access (Trade Y) raises confidence relative to the
            retail-style environment (Trade X), we ran a regression to ask a second question:
            <strong>who</strong> experiences the biggest confidence boost? To study this, we used the
            change in confidence <code>(Trade&nbsp;Y confidence − Trade&nbsp;X confidence)</code> as the
            dependent variable and regressed it on investors’ comfort with delayed quotes,
            their use of news sites and Twitter for market information, and the number of
            finance courses they have taken. The idea was to test whether investors who rely
            more on fast, real-time data or who have more formal training benefit differently
            from richer information.
          </p>
        
          <p style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 16px;">
            With our small sample, the model explains only a modest share of the variation
            in confidence changes (R² ≈ 0.24), and <strong>none of the individual predictors are
            statistically significant at conventional levels</strong>. The coefficient on comfort with
            delayed quotes is positive and borderline significant, while news, Twitter use,
            and number of finance courses are all imprecisely estimated with large
            p-values. In practice, this means we do not find strong evidence that any
            particular subgroup of investors drives the confidence gains. Instead, the
            improvement in confidence from Trade X to Trade Y appears to be
            <strong>broad-based</strong>, rather than concentrated among only highly informed,
            highly online, or highly educated investors.

            Do Investors Become More Optimistic With Better Information?
          </h2>
            <br></br>
        
          <p style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6;">
          After measuring the effect of institutional-style access (Trade Y) on confidence, we ran a second model to answer a deeper question: 
          <strong>does better information actually make investors more optimistic about returns?</strong> 
          To explore this, we created a variable capturing the change in expected returns 
          <code>(Trade&nbsp;Y expected return – Trade&nbsp;X expected return)</code> 
          and regressed it on several investor characteristics, including risk aversion, number of finance courses completed, comfort with delayed quotes, and reliance on social-based information sources such as friends or Discord. The goal was to test whether any particular subgroup becomes systematically more bullish when given richer information.

          <p style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 16px;">
          The regression results show that this model explains very little of the variation in return differences <em>(R² ≈ 0.13)</em>, and 
          <strong>none of the predictors are statistically significant</strong>. 
          Risk attitudes, education, social information sources, and comfort with delayed quotes all have imprecise estimates with large p-values. In practical terms, this means that institutional-style access does <strong>not</strong> make any particular type of investor more optimistic. Instead, expected returns remain remarkably stable across environments.  
          <br><br>
          This supports an important conclusion: 
          <strong>institutional information increases confidence, not optimism.</strong>  
          Investors feel more certain, but not more bullish, when given richer, more professional-style information.

          Does Better Information Change Investors’ Perception of Fairness?
        </h2>
        <br></br>
        
        <p style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6;">
          We introduced this third regression to evaluate whether institutional-style information 
          (Trade&nbsp;Y) affects not only confidence or expected returns, but also whether investors 
          perceive the trading environment as <strong>more or less fair</strong>. To measure this, 
          we constructed a fairness difference variable (Trade&nbsp;Y fairness − Trade&nbsp;X fairness) 
          and regressed it on several investor characteristics, including comfort with delayed quotes, 
          number of finance courses completed, and risk–loss aversion. The goal was to assess whether 
          richer, institutional-style information systematically changes fairness perceptions for any 
          subgroup of investors.
        </p>
        
        <p style="color: #d1d5db; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 16px;">
          The regression results show that the model explains only a modest share of variation in fairness 
          differences (R² ≈ 0.27), and 
          <strong>none of the predictors reach statistical significance</strong>. Comfort with delayed 
          quotes has a negative coefficient, weakly suggesting that investors who prefer real-time 
          information might view Trade&nbsp;Y as somewhat fairer, but the estimate is not statistically 
          meaningful. Risk–loss aversion and financial education similarly show no clear relationships. 
          Overall, these findings indicate that institutional-style information does 
          <strong>not</strong> systematically change fairness perceptions. Instead, fairness judgments appear 
          relatively stable and largely unaffected by differences in information access.
