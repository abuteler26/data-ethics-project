    <p class="viz-caption">
      Above we can see that of our survey participants, about half of them were seniors. Ideally, we would have had roughly the same amount
      from each year group because seniors might have more experience investing and see it in a slightly different light compared to a freshmen.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="Investing-experience-dist.png" alt="Investing-experience-dist" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      The graph above shows out that approximately 75% of the survey respondents have been investing for half a year to five years. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="Most-common-majors.png" alt="Most-common-majors" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      Here we can see that the most common declared major amongst our survey participants was economics, followed by data science, which means
      that this survey reached individuals which are likley to be interested in this topic and as a result, are likely to have spent more time
      thinking about their responses. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="most-common-minors.png" alt="most-common-minors" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      Clearly, there aren't near as many minors as majors. However, it is still interesting to note that the most relevant minor is data science.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="platform-usage-counts.png" alt="platform-usage-counts" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      This graph shows us that for our survey participants, the most commonly used app was Robinhood, which makes our historical analysis of Robinhood relatively
      relevant because we are sure that the type of people using Robinhood between 2018-2020 and now is similar, if not the same. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="asset-class-usage-count.png" alt="asset-class-usage-count" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      Similarly, the most looked at asset class by participants was US equities, or in other words, stocks. Thus, using a handful of stocks for
      our historical analysis seemed appropriate.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="confidence-x-dist.png" alt="confidence-x-dist" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      This first boxplot shows us that participants’ confidence in the Company X decision is fairly spread out, with a median at 4, indicating moderate confidence, and 
      the IQR being between 2 and 6.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="confidence-y-dist.png" alt="confidence-y-dist" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      This second boxplot shows us that participants' confidence in the Company Y decision was improved and as evenly spread out
      as before, with a higher median of 6, and the IQR being slightly smaller between 4 and 7.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="trade-x-week-return.png" alt="trade-x-week-return" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      The histogram shows that most participants expected a 1-week return of around 10% for Trade X,
      but there is considerable variability with some very optimistic outliers projecting returns above 20–30%.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="trade-y-week-return.png" alt="trade-y-week-return" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      Compared to Trade X, expectations for Trade Y are more optimistic and spread out where most participants still 
      cluster around 10–20% returns, but the richer information environment leads to both higher upside projections 
      and a few negative outliers, reflecting greater conviction and differentiated risk assessments.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="loss-aversion.png" alt="loss-aversion" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      Most participants showed moderate loss aversion in the $50–$100 range, but a few were willing to tolerate 
      much larger losses (up to $300), indicating substantial variation in individual risk tolerance.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="15min-quote.png" alt="15min-quote" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      Participants were generally somewhat uncomfortable with a 15-minute quote delay, with most responses 
      clustering between 2 and 4, although a few were either very accepting or very resistant to it.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="bubble-graph-x.png" alt="bubble-graph-x" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      The plot shows that most respondents clustered around an expected return of about 10% with moderate confidence around 5 or 6, 
      while very high or very low return expectations tended to correspond with more varied and often lower confidence levels.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="bubble-graph-y.png" alt="bubble-graph-y" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      The plot shows that expected returns for Trade Y are more widely dispersed than for Trade X–ranging from negative values to high positives–but 
      confidence tends to cluster around moderate-to-high levels (5 to 8), suggesting that richer information access enables stronger conviction even 
      when return expectations diverge.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="Trade-x-fairness.png" alt="Trade-x-fairness" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      Most participants rated the information in Trade X as relatively unfair, with responses concentrated toward the lower end of the 
      scale, indicating that limited and delayed access was widely perceived as disadvantaging retail investors.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="Trade-y-fairness.png" alt="Trade-y-fairness" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      Perceptions of fairness improved in Trade Y, with responses clustering around the middle to higher end of the scale, 
      suggesting that access to richer, real-time information was generally viewed as more equitable compared to the delayed-data setting.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="kde-fairness.png" alt="kde-fairness" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      The KDE comparison shows that perceived fairness was noticeably higher in the institutional-like setting (Trade Y), 
      with its distribution shifted to the right relative to Trade X, indicating that richer, real-time data access made 
      the trading environment feel significantly fairer to participants.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block">
    <img src="information-source.png" alt="information-source" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      Most participants reported relying on traditional news sites and social channels like Discord and Twitter/X as their 
      main sources of market information, while platforms such as podcasts, Instagram, and TikTok were used far less frequently.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="viz-block viz-block-wide">
    <img src="correlations.png" alt="correlations" class="viz-img">
    <p class="viz-caption">
      The heatmap shows generally weak correlations across most variables, but hints that higher confidence and larger trade allocations may be modestly associated, 
      while greater loss aversion tends to correlate negatively with risk-taking and more aggressive expected returns.
